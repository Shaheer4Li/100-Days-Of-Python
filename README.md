# Password-generator-Begginer-
<p> <h3>Day 05/100</h3> As you guys also know, this is not something advanced or something very big, but I am still pushing it to my GitHub to maintain consistency. </p> <p style="color:#FFFF00"> <h3>Why start from Day 5</h3> I started a course named **100 Days of Python by Angela Yu**, and I am following that course. But the first 4 projects are not too complex and cannot be creatively done, so I picked from Day 5 and so on. </p> <p> <h1>Explanation</h1> So in this project, I just changed the idea from the course a bit. The idea in the course is simple: we have to generate a random password according to letters, numbers, and symbols. But I changed that to generating a password based on a keyword.

So my idea is based on the leetspeak concept, and it is an updated version
of the code in the course.
