<h3 style="color:#FF6F00">📅 Day 05 / 100</h3> <p> As you guys also know, this is not something advanced or something very big, but I am still pushing it to my GitHub to maintain consistency. </p>
<h3 style="color:#FFFF00">🤔 Why start from Day 5?</h3> <p> I started a course named <b>100 Days of Python by Angela Yu</b>, and I am following that course. But the first 4 projects are not too complex and cannot be creatively done, so I picked from Day 5 and so on. </p>
<h1 style="color:#00E676">🧠 Explanation</h1> <p> So in this project, I just changed the idea from the course a bit. The idea in the course is simple: we have to generate a random password according to letters, numbers, and symbols. But I changed that to generating a password based on a keyword. </p> <p> So my idea is based on the <b>leetspeak</b> concept, and it is an updated version of the code in the course. </p>
