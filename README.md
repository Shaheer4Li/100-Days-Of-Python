<h3 style="color:#FF6F00">📅 Day 05 / 100</h3> <p> As you guys also know, this is not something advanced or something very big, but I am still pushing it to my GitHub to maintain consistency. </p>
<h3 style="color:#FFFF00">🤔 Why start from Day 5?</h3> <p> I started a course named <b>100 Days of Python by Angela Yu</b>, and I am following that course. But the first 4 projects are not too complex and cannot be creatively done, so I picked from Day 5 and so on. </p>
<h1 style="color:#00E676">🧠 Explanation</h1> <p> So in this project, I just changed the idea from the course a bit. The idea in the course is simple: we have to generate a random password according to letters, numbers, and symbols. But I changed that to generating a password based on a keyword. </p> <p> So my idea is based on the <b>leetspeak</b> concept, and it is an updated version of the code in the course. </p>

<h3 style="color:#FF6F00">📅 Day 06 / 100</h3> <p> No coding project but practiced skills on website called Reborg's world by solving hurdle 1,2,3,4 and After that Solved maze problem on same website </p>

<h1 style="color:#00E676">🧠 Explanation</h1> <p> So in this project, I didnot learn to create anything but challenged my problem solving skills using basic for, while, if, elif conditionals this task was kind of reality check that even if I can create whole of game in python but still can struck at problem solving. so problem solving skills are nesecery to learn and implement .</p>

<h3 style="color:#FF6F00">📅 Day 07 / 100</h3> <p>  today I created Hangman game. maybe you have played and even created this game using python is past</p>

<h1 style="color:#00E676">🧠 Explanation</h1> <p> This project is also for strenthning my skills in conditonals and strings. during creating this I have learned a quite alot first of all I learned about multi line statement prints and there use in printing ascii art and also I have learned importance of indentation because I stuck several time here due to just indentation. Because indentation Mistakes are quite tricky to find out sometimes yourcode doesnot even send indentation error but your program just working abnormally so you have to find that bug youself and that was seriously hard,So keep track where you put what .</p>


<h3 style="color:#FF6F00">📅 Day 08 / 100</h3> <p> I Implemented ceaser cipher encrypter and decrypter</p>

<h1 style="color:#00E676">🧠 Explanation</h1> <p> If you are not familliar who ceaser is and what ceaser cipher is then I am giving links to wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher .......https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar so that you can get idea what i tried to achieve. It is also not too complex program and the way i have done it is very very basic but still it kinda help in strengthing my concept of functions in python specially functions with arguement. there is obviously better approaches to implement this progaram but for practice current one is best. </p>
